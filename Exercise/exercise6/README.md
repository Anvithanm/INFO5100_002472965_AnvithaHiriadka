# Message Encryption and Descryption - Cryptography
This exercise demonstrates Message Encryption and Decryption of messages exchanged between Alice and Bob, as well as message signing.<br>
The two type encryptions are demonstrated here<br>
- Symmetric Encryption and Decryption of message
- Asymmetric Encryption and Decryption of message

## Introduction
In this Exercise, we illustrate three cryptographic techniques:

1) Symmetric Encryption and Decryption: Encrypting and decrypting messages using AES-256 with AES/GCM/NoPadding cipher.
2) Asymmetric Encryption and Decryption: Encrypting and decrypting messages using RSA-2048 with RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding.
3) Message Signing and Validation: Signing a message using RSA-2048 keys and validating the signature.

## Instructions
To run the demo, follow these steps:

- Compile and run the provided Java code.
- View the console output to observe the results of symmetric and asymmetric encryption, as well as message signing and validation.

## Usage
- Message_cryptography.java contains the main() code demonstrating the cryptographic techniques.
- Encrypt_message.java has function for encryption of message for both the cases Symmetric and Asymmetric.
- Decrypt_message.java has function for decryption of message for both the cases Symmetric and Asymmetric.

## Dependencies
This project requires Java 8

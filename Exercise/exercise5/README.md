Excercise5

This is a console program to demonstrate the use (in real-life like example) for three design pattern implementation in Java.

exercise5 Package shows implementation 3 different Design Patterns under each category of Design Pattern.

1) Factory Method Design Pattern [Creational Design Pattern]
2) Facade Design Pattern [Structural Design Pattern]
3) Iterator Design Pattern [Behavioral Design Pattern]

------------
1) Factory Method Design Pattern [Creational Design Pattern]
    
    The java files associated with pattern are
   - Beverages.java - Interface Class
   - Coffee.java - Concrete Class
   - Smoothie.java - Concrete Class
   - Tea.java - Concrete Class
   - BeverageFactory.java
   - FactoryPatternDemo.java[main]


2) Facade Design Pattern [Structural Design Pattern]

   The java files associated with pattern are
    - Beverages.java - Interface Class
    - Coffee.java - Concrete Class
    - Smoothie.java - Concrete Class
    - Tea.java - Concrete Class
    - BeverageMaker.java
    - FacadePatternDemo.java[main]


3) Iterator Design Pattern [Behavioral Design Pattern]

   The java files associated with pattern are
    - Iterator.java - Interface Class
    - Container.java - Interface Class
    - SnackRepository.java
    - IteratorPatternDemo.java[main]
